Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you’ll be using) made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!"

Quizzes will cover material presented in previous classes and assignments during the weeks since the most-recent quiz.\nQuizzes are short (10 minutes) and are designed to test for fluency and to demonstrate where additional study is needed. Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them. The phenomenon and research on it is explained in detail in the book “Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning,” by Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel."

If you do AI tools on assignments in this class, you must include the prompt(s) you used as well as changed to made to them to get better results to receive full credit. I want to see how you are using them. Be transparent - that is all I ask.\nFor writing assistance, LLMs are again permitted, but again I want to see how you used them. If you used an LLM to help you with any of the writing portions of your assignments, include a section called “Use of AI on this assignment” and describe which tool(s) we used and how they were used.\nYour goal in using tools like ChatGPT should be to see them as an assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than as a solutions manual. Take the time to work through the code / text these tools generate and ensure that what they provide is accurate, and if not make the corrections to fix their mistakes.\n\nCurious how LLMs actually work? Check out this article, which provides a simplified description of how they work (which itself is still quite complicated)."

Even if you work together on an assignment, write your own code.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from any person not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours / Slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!"

Proposal Contents\nYour proposal should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: If your team is working on a policy project rather than a product, see the Policy Proposal Contents section below.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing the overall proposal and convincing the reader why it is important. Specifically, tell the reader:\n\nWhat is the product you are studying?\nWhat key product attributes make it different than its competitors?\nWhat major research questions will you focus on for your analysis?\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product or technology. Include a picture or diagram of the product.\n\n\nMarket Opportunity\n\nIdentify Your Customer\nIf there are multiple potential markets, choose one to focus on for your analysis. Describe who you plan on taking your survey and how you intend to gain access to that population. You may survey customers of a “downstream” product, if appropriate (e.g. survey electric vehicle buyers to learn about preferences for electric vehicle battery attributes).\n\n\nIdentify Competitors\nWhich other products will compete with yours? Benchmark how competitors compare on your product’s attributes.\n\n\nIdentify Market Size\nEstimate the size of the annual market (expected sales in units per year) for this product and its competitors. Specify if your estimated annual market size is regional, national, or global, and provide references. Also address how the market size is expected to grow in the future.\n\n\n\nProduct Attributes & Research Questions\nA key component of your proposal is to identify the relationships between your product attributes and research questions.\n\nProduct Attributes\nThese are the product features that consumers observe and care about. For example, price is almost always an important product attribute that influences consumer choices. You should list and describe the major product attributes you will include in your analysis. Where possible, label the product attributes on the diagram of your design. Where possible, quantify the metrics for each attribute (e.g. if one of your attributes is weight, the metric could be “kilograms”). Also list the set or range of possible levels you plan to explore for each attribute (e.g. for color you may choose the set {red, green, blue}, or for price you may choose the range $1 - $10).\nSummarize your product attributes in a table, identifying the basic features of your attributes as well as the features of current competitors. Use this example as a template.\n\n\nResearch Questions\nYour research questions are the central decisions that you are trying to inform with your project, and they often are directly related to the product attributes! For example, a research question on a project about solar panels might be “how thick should the cells be?”. This question affects multiple product attributes, such as the weight (thicker cells are heavier), price (thicker cells use more material), lifetime (cell thickness may affect how quickly a cell degrades), etc. You should discuss ~2-3 key research questions that are related to your product’s design. Discuss why you chose these questions, and note any relationship between the questions you are asking and the attributes of your product.\n\n\n\nOther Questions\nList major outstanding questions (e.g. about the product / technology performance metrics, market opportunities, etc.) that you will need to know to conduct your analysis and how you propose to find answers. The purpose of this section is to identify high-priority items that you will need to know early on in your project.\n\n\nAttribution\nInclude a short description of the specific contributions of each team member in your team. Here is an example:\n\n\nStudent A wrote the initial proposal draft.\nStudent B identified the market opportunity and created the product attribute table.\nStudent C helped organize project files and edited the final draft of the proposal.\n\n\nIf all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution."

Who are you planning on getting to take your survey, and how you intend to gain access to that population? Include an estimate of the size of the total target population.\n\n\nPolicy Options\n\nIdentify Policy Options\nWhich policies are you considering, and what are some of the potential pros and cons of them? Are some easier / more feasible to implement or enforce than others? Are some more costly to implement than others? Include a summary table comparing some basic features of each policy, e.g.\n\n\n\nPolicy\nDescription\nPro\nCon\n\n\n\n\nPolicy 1\nBrief description\nEasily implemented\nExpensive\n\n\nPolicy 2\nBrief description\nHard to enforce\nCheap\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Policy Attributes\nFor each policy, identify the key attributes that your target population will observe. For example, if the policy involves a fee or tax, then the amount of that fee or tax would be a key attribute. For each attribute, specify the range of possible levels you plan to explore (e.g. for amount you may choose the range $1 - $10). You should choose levels that reflect the range of existing policies or potential policies. You may choose to include policies / attributes that have not yet been implemented as well.\n\n\n\nResearch Questions\nYour research questions are the central decisions that you are trying to inform with your project, and they often are directly related to the policy options and attributes.\n\n\nQuestions\nList major outstanding questions that you will need to know to conduct your analysis and how you propose to find answers.

    "text": "Department: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides students with data analysis techniques to inform design decisions in an uncertain, competitive market; topics include consumer choice modeling, programming in the R programming language, survey design, conjoint analysis, optimization, market simulation, and professional communication skills. Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nImport, wrangle, visualize, and export data in R.\nDesign surveys to obtain informative data about consumer preferences for product features.\nBuild and estimate discrete choice models.\nAnalyze consumer choice data to estimate consumer preferences for product features.\nDesign and create effective charts and presentations.\nCommunicate results in terms of design insights.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThis course requires prior exposure to:\n\nProbability theory\nMultivariable calculus\nLinear algebra\nRegression\n\nEach of these concepts will be applied throughout the course, and no time will be spent reviewing the foundational elements of each concept.\nIn addition, we will work in the R programming language throughout the course, but no prior programming experience is required. We will spend the first three weeks going through exercises to get up to speed in R.\nStudents are encouraged to complete this self assessment prior to registering for the course to self-assess familiarity with these concepts."

But it is helpful at this stage to see an overview of the overall survey structure and how a conjoint survey can be built in formr.\nWith that in mind, read through this blog post I wrote on how to implement a choice-based conjoint survey in formr. It may not yet be immediately clear what every single piece of code is doing, but reading it at least once will help as we go forward with the class.

Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw2.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nIf you’re unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\n\n\n\n5. Submit\nTo submit your assignment, follow these instructions:\n\nRender your .qmd file by either clicking the “Render” button in RStudio or running the command quarto::quarto_render(\"hw2.qmd\") command.\nOpen the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard."

Assume that we know the observed utility of each bar to be \\(v_m = 3\\) and \\(v_d = 4\\). Using a logit model, compute the probabilities of choosing each bar: \\(P_m\\) and \\(P_d\\).\n\n\\[P_m = \\frac{e^{v_m}}{e^{v_m} + e^{v_d}} = \\frac{e^3}{e^3 + e^4}\\]\n\ndenom &lt;- exp(3) + exp(4)\nexp(3) / denom\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2689414\n\n\n\\[P_d = \\frac{e^{v_d}}{e^{v_m} + e^{v_d}} = \\frac{e^4}{e^3 + e^4}\\]\n\nexp(4) / denom\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.7310586\n\n\n\nA third bar of chocolate is now added to the choice set. It is the exact same as the milk chocolate bar, but it has a slightly different wrapper (which has no effect on the consumer’s utility). Now, \\(v_{m1} = v_{m2} = 3\\), and \\(v_d = 4\\). Based on the probabilities from question a), what would we expect the probabilities of choosing each bar to be? What probabilities does the logit model produce?\n\nSince the utilities for the two milk chocolate bars are equivalent, we would expect the milk chocolate bars to split the probability from part a:\n\\[P_{m1} = P_{m2} = \\frac{0.27}{2} = 0.135\\]\nand the dark chocolate bar should remain the same:\n\\[P_d = 0.73\\]\nHowever, when we compute the logit fractions we get the following results:\n\\[P_{m1} = P_{m2} = \\frac{e^{v_{m1}}}{e^{v_{m1}} + e^{v_{m2}} + e^{v_d}} = \\frac{e^3}{e^3 + e^3 + e^4}\\]\n\ndenom &lt;- exp(3) + exp(3) + exp(4)\nexp(3) / denom\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.2119416\n\n\n\\[P_d = \\frac{e^{v_d}}{e^{v_{m1}} + e^{v_{m2}} + e^{v_d}} = \\frac{e^4}{e^3 + e^3 + e^4}\\]\n\nexp(4) / denom\n\n#&gt; [1] 0.5761169\n\n\nWe can see that the IIA property of the logit model is distorting the probabilities away from what we would expect. The predicted probabilities for the milk chocolate bars are higher than we would expect.\n\n\nHW Question 3\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nBar 1\nBar 2\nBar 3\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n$1.20\n$1.50\n$3.00\n\n\n% Cacao\n10%\n60%\n80%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite out a model for the observed utility of each chocolate bar in the above set.\n\nLet’s say the coefficient for price is \\(\\beta_1\\) and the coefficient for the percent of cacao is \\(\\beta_2\\).

Over the course of the semester, students will learn and apply theory and methods to a team project to assess the market competitiveness of an emerging product / technology and use marketing analytics to generate design insights. At the end of the semester, students will submit a final, reproducible report of their project along with a presentation of their findings. This course has a “flipped” classroom structure. Students will spend the majority of class time working through guiding practice exercises or working on their projects. To prepare for class, students must complete weekly assignments that involve watching and reviewing recorded lecture materials and answering related practice questions.\nThis course was first created by Dr. John Paul Helveston at the George Washington University for the Spring 2019 semester of EMSE 6035, which was previously called Marketing of Technology.

What is the answer to the equation?\nA random variable, \\(\\tilde{x}\\), has a uniform distribution between the values 0 and 1. Draw the probability density function (PDF) and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of \\(\\tilde{x}\\).\nThe value of a random variable, \\(\\tilde{x}\\), is determined by rolling one fair, 6-sided dice. Draw the PDF and CDF of \\(\\tilde{x}\\).\n\n\n\nHW Question 2\n\nA consumer is making a choice between two bars of chocolate: milk chocolate \\((m)\\) and dark chocolate \\((d)\\). Assume that we know the observed utility of each bar to be \\(v_m = 3\\) and \\(v_d = 4\\). Using a logit model, compute the probabilities of choosing each bar: \\(P_m\\) and \\(P_d\\).\n\n\n# Write code here\n\n\n# Write code here\n\n\nA third bar of chocolate is now added to the choice set. It is the exact same as the milk chocolate bar, but it has a slightly different wrapper (which has no effect on the consumer’s utility). Now, \\(v_{m1} = v_{m2} = 3\\), and \\(v_d = 4\\).

    "text": "Installing packages from Github: the BRRR library\nThe vast majority of the time, you will install external packages using the install.packages() function. This installs packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), where most packages are published. But you can also install packages that are under development or haven’t been published to CRAN yet. Most of the time, these packages are hosted on GitHub - an online platform for sharing code (it’s also where all of the files that make up this website are stored).\nTo install a package from GitHub, you first need to install the remotes library. Then you can use the remotes::install_github()` function to install packages directly from GitHub. To try this out, install the remotes library, then trying installing the BRRR package:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"brooke-watson/BRRR\")\n\n\nNote: Packges on GitHub are in development and often require other packges to work. So if you get an installation error about some other package dependency, try restarting your R session and try again.\n\nNot sure what this package does? Well, one of the other nice things about packages listed on GitHub is the authors tend to write detailed descriptions - check out the GitHub page for the BRRR package. Then try using the BRRR::skrrrahh() function with different number arguments (turn your volume up). In the #welcome channel on slack, post your favorite argument to skrrrahh() (mine is 24)."

I’m not grading your writing ability and I’m not counting the number of words you write - I’m looking for thoughtful engagement. One or two sentences is not enough. Write at least a paragraph and show me that you did the readings assigned.\n\n\n1. Get Organized\nFollow these instructions:\n\nDownload and edit this template.\nUnzip the template folder. Make sure you actually unzip it! (in Windows, right-click it and use “extract all”)\nOpen the .Rproj file to open RStudio.\nInside RStudio, open the hw3.qmd file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.\n\n\n\n2. Readings\nNext week we will start getting into designing conjoint surveys for our projects. We will implement them using formr.org, which is an R-based platform for designing surveys. The platform allows you to use R or markdown code (just like you would in a .Rmd file) to define everything you see in an online survey. All survey elements are defined using Google Sheets.\nTo get familiar with the platform, go to this post on my website and watch the ~45 min video on the page. It is a recording of me introducing formr.org at a GW Coders community meet up back in 2021. The first 5 minutes is a high level introduction, and the rest of the video goes into a detailed demo of the platform.\nTake notes as you watch the video.\nAt the bottom of the page in the section titled “Surveys with {formr}”, you can see links to the actual surveys I used in the video.\n\n\n3. Make a practice survey\nNormally I would have each team create their own account on formr.org, but at the moment the site is undergoing several upgrades and they have temporarily suspended new accounts. So, the work around for this semester will be for every team to use the same account. I will post the log in information on the class Slack in the #projects channel.\nFor practice, try replicating the random images survey I demonstrated in the video. Follow these steps:\n\nMake a copy of the survey Google Sheet in GW Google Drive account. Make sure you turn the share settings on so that anyone can view it (if you don’t, formr won’t be able to read it in).\nLog in to formr.org and create a new survey using that Google Sheet. Name your survey practice_netID, replacing netID with your netID (e.g. practice_jph).\nOnce you have your survey uploaded, you can make it live by creating a “Run”. Create a new run, and give it the same name as your survey name. Add your survey to the run by clicking on the  icon, then add a stopping point by clicking the  icon.\nThe link to the survey will be https://your_run_name.formr.org. You can control whether your survey is “live” or not by modifying the “volume” icons. I recommend setting it to the  icon, which means people who have the link can access the survey.\nTry it out! See if the survey works as expected. You can also click through a few times and then see the response data by going to your survey (not the run) in the formr.org admin page.\n\n\n\n4. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw3.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nIf you’re unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\n\n\n\n5. Submit\nTo submit your assignment, follow these instructions:\n\nRender your .qmd file by either clicking the “Render” button in RStudio or running the command quarto::quarto_render(\"hw3.qmd\") command.\nOpen the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard."

Throughout the video, I ask practice questions at several places - you should answer to those questions as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.\nClick here to download the slides in the video as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in more details about the logit model, see Chapter 3 (free pdf) of Kenneth Train’s book, “Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation”\n\n\n3. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw5.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nIf you’re unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\n\n\n\n4. Submit\nTo submit your assignment, follow these instructions:\n\nRender your .qmd file by either clicking the “Render” button in RStudio or running the command quarto::quarto_render(\"hw5.qmd\") command.\nOpen the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard."

    "text": "Due: 2023-10-24 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 1.33% of your final grade.\nPurpose: The purpose of this assignment is to introduce how we quantify uncertainty around estimated parameters that result from maximizing the log-likelihood function.\nAssessment: This assignment is graded using a check system:\n\n✔+ (110%): Responses shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.\n✔ (100%): Responses are thoughtful, well-written, and show engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n✔− (50%): Responses are hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that this is essentially a pass/fail system. I’m not grading your writing ability and I’m not counting the number of words you write - I’m looking for thoughtful engagement. One or two sentences is not enough. Write at least a paragraph and show me that you did the readings assigned.\n\n\nPilot Surveys\nIn addition to the assignment below, this week you should also help out your fellow classmates by providing feedback on their pilot surveys. For every team other than your own, answer their pilot survey and provide any feedback you have in a row in this spreadsheet. Feedback should be anonymous, constructive, and objective. Note things that didn’t work and / or things that weren’t clear or were confusing.\nIf you got screened out early in the survey, go back and take it again and pick a response so that you won’t get screened out. Do your best to actually answer the conjoint questions honestly (don’t just click randomly).\nCompleting all the surveys shouldn’t take more than an hour. In addition to giving everyone very useful feedback, this exercise may also give you new ideas for improving your own survey.\n\n\n1. Get Organized\nFollow these instructions:\n\nDownload and edit this template.\nUnzip the template folder. Make sure you actually unzip it! (in Windows, right-click it and use “extract all”)\nOpen the .Rproj file to open RStudio.\nInside RStudio, open the hw7.qmd file, take notes, and write some example code as you go through the readings / exercises below.\n\n\n\n2. Readings\nLast week we introduced how we can use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the unknown parameters of utility models. This week we’ll learn about how to quantify the uncertainty associated with those parameter estimates by watching the third video in our Youtube playlist on choice modeling: Uncertainty\nTake notes as you watch the video. Throughout the video, I ask practice questions at several places - you should answer to those questions as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.\nClick here to download the slides in the video as a PDF.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Reflect\nReflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your hw7.qmd file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.\nIf you’re unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\n\n\n\n4. Submit\nTo submit your assignment, follow these instructions:\n\nRender your .qmd file by either clicking the “Render” button in RStudio or running the command quarto::quarto_render(\"hw7.qmd\") command.\nOpen the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard."

    "text": "Throughout the semester, you will work in teams of 3-4 students towards a final project. The project will have three phases:\n\nProject proposal\nPilot survey & analysis\nFinal survey & analysis\n\nTeams will apply topics covered in class to develop quantitative models of consumer choice to inform design decisions for a novel product, technology, or policy. Each team will have somewhat different tasks and areas of emphasis, depending on the product selected; however, all projects will be expected to demonstrate mastery of the topics covered in class and to address the criteria and guidelines required for project assignments.\nSummary of Deliverables: To make the overall project more manageable, it is broken down into separate “milestone” deliverables due throughout the semester, starting with a proposal.\n\n\n\n\nItem\nWeight towardsfinal grade\nDue Date(by 11:59pm)\n\n\n\n\nProject Proposal\n5 %\nSep. 24\n\n\nSurvey Plan\n5 %\nOct. 03\n\n\nPilot Survey\n5 %\nOct. 17\n\n\nPilot Analysis\n5 %\nNov. 05\n\n\nFinal Survey\n5 %\nNov. 19\n\n\nFinal Analysis Report\n15 %\nDec. 10\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n5 %\nDec. 12\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Selection\nI want this project to be as useful for you and your future career as possible - you’ll hopefully want to show off your final project in a portfolio or during job interviews. Accordingly, you get to choose the topic for your project, but it must meet certain guidelines.\nProjects must be selected during the first two weeks of class. Projects much be an emerging technology, product, or policy with a clearly identified market that has not yet been introduced into the mass market, such as a new invention from a research laboratory at GWU or a new product being explored by a firm. Students have the option to choose a sponsored project or propose their own project if it is approved by the instructor and meets the following criteria:\n\nInnovative / Emerging: The proposed project involves a new product or technology with attributes (e.g. price, efficiency, reliability, size, performance, color, etc.) that may be competitive in the marketplace but for which actual market adoption is still uncertain.\nWell-Defined: This course focuses on mathematical modeling to support design decision-making. There is not sufficient time in the course for conceptual design of a new product.\nIdentified Target Market: A target market has been identified for this new product or technology. Competing products in that market are known, and the attributes on which new market entrants compete can be identified. Representative potential customers can be identified for survey solicitation. If the new product or technology is a component of a larger product sold to a consumer market, students may assess the market implications for the final consumer product.\nPrior to Mass Commercialization: The new product or technology has only recently or has not yet been introduced to the mass market.\nModerate Scope and Complexity: The product or technology should involve moderate complexity. For example, a non-differentiated commodity, such as sugar, is too simple, and a complex product involving many components and manufacturing operations, such as a vehicle, is too complex.\nExpertise: If the product involves a new technology that requires specialized knowledge about its attributes, the team should have reliable access to experts who can supply the requisite knowledge.\nDecision Variables: The product should have several non-trivial design decisions. For example, choosing between two materials or topologies, setting dimensions of a component, or selecting among a set of alternative component configurations are suitable design decisions. The models developed in the project will be used to support decision-making along such dimensions.\n\n\n\nTeamwork\nThe experience of working in teams on this project will serve as preparation for teamwork throughout your careers. Some teams may experience an imbalance in team member contributions, effort, or reliability. The instructor is available to provide advice and interact in resolving team inequity and conflict; however, students should view this as a learning experience. Such situations regularly occur in any career, and learning how to handle them is a valuable skill. If you experience challenges within your team, it is a good opportunity to develop strategies and figure out how you will address such challenges in the future. One common job interview question is, “Describe a time when you experienced difficulties working in a team or experienced a team failure. What did you do about it?” This is a good chance to build a strong answer to this question."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Due: Oct 03 by 11:59pm\nWeight: This assignment is worth 5% of your final grade.\nAssessment: Your submission will be assessed using the rubric at the bottom of this page.\n\nAs a team, write a survey plan to guide your survey design in formr. This plan does not have to be “set in stone” but rather a first attempt at defining the scope and general content of your survey. The course instructor will review and grade your plan and provide written feedback to guide the development of your pilot survey. Follow the instructions below to prepare your survey plan.\n\n1. Get Organized\nDownload and unzip this template for your survey plan. Open the survey_plan.Rproj file and write your plan in the survey_plan.qmd file. The template comes with some text and code explaining how to use it - you should delete this code / text as it is only for explanatory purposes. Be sure to adjust the content in the YAML:\n\nWrite your project title in the title field (and provide a subtitle if you wish, or delete the subtitle field).\nIn the author field, list the names of all teammates, e.g. author: Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo.\n\n\n\n2. Specify the Target Population\nWhat is the ideal population you would like to take your survey? If you cannot access this population, is there a different or similar population that you are planning to target?\nWrite out your eligibility requirements for people to be considered part of your target population. Be specific. Write the exact question language you plan to use in your survey (e.g. “Are you a car owner?”) to identify the target sample. You may need to ask more than one question.\nBy default, we will pay users on prolific.co (i.e. people from the general U.S. population) to take your survey, but if a specific subpopulation is required (e.g. people currently shopping for a car), list that here and perhaps one or two strategies for reaching that population. If you have any other opportunities to distribute your survey to the target population (e.g. an external collaborator, personal networks, etc.), list those here.\n\n\n3. Attributes and Levels for Choice Questions\nWrite the text of the choice question you plan on asking your respondents. Below your question, list in a table the attributes and levels you will include in your choice questions (these may change between now and the actual final survey).\nFor example, for a survey on car preferences, you might use this as a choice question:\n\n“If these were your only options, which vehicle would you choose?”\n\nAnd you might use these as your attributes and levels:\n\n\n\nAttribute\nLevels\nUnit\n\n\n\n\nPrice\n15, 20, 25\n$1000\n\n\nFuel economy\n20, 25, 30\nMiles per gallon\n\n\nAcceleration time\n6, 7, 8\nSeconds (from 0-60 mph)\n\n\nPowertrain\nGasoline, Electric\nType\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Survey Content\nYour survey plan should include the following additional content (much of this will go directly into your pilot survey):\n\nWelcome page text: Welcome your survey respondents and inform them in just a few sentences who you are and what the survey is about.\nConsent page text: Write out the text of a consent form and include restrictions at least for 18 years of age and the statement “I have read and understand the above information” (in your survey, this can go on the welcome page).\nEducation information: Write out descriptions of the attributes you will include in your conjoint choice questions so that you can explain them to your survey respondents. Use common, simple language and as few words as possible. Include illustrative images if possible.\nCritical respondent information: What pieces of information about your respondent are absolutely necessary for your analysis (e.g. demographic factors like income, age, etc., or other information specific to the market for your product). Again, write the specific questions you plan on asking.\nOther questions: What other information about your respondents would be helpful in your analysis? Are you planning on asking any behavioral or demographic questions? Include the specific question text you plan to include.\n\n\n\n4. Attribution\nInclude a short description of the specific contributions of each team member for this report. If all members contributed equally, you can just put the single sentence “All members contributed equally”.\nTeam members who do not make meaningful contributions to their projects will not receive the same grade as that of their team mates. If you are having any issues or disputes among team members, please contact Professor Helveston ASAP so we can find a resolution.\n\n\n5. Submit\nRender your survey_plan.qmd file, then create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard. Only one person from your team should submit the report.\n\n\nGrading Rubric\n35 Total Points\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nExcellent\nGood\nNeeds work\n\n\n\n\nOrganization & Formatting\n5\nAll formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correct with all team members listed; Rmd compiles to html.\n4\nMost formatting guidelines are followed; YAML is correct with all team members listed; Rmd might require one fix to compile to html.\n3\nSeveral or all formatting guidelines not followed; YAML contains elements that aren't updated from the template; Rmd requires mutliple fixes to compile to html.\n\n\nTarget Population\n10 / 9\nTarget population clearly identified; fielding strategy is discussed; eligibility requirement question text is specified.\n8 / 7 / 6\nTarget population identified, though may need to be refined; fielding strategy is discussed; eligibility requirement question text needs to be refined.\n5 / 4 / 3\nTarget population unclear; fielding strategy missing; eligibility requirement question text needs to be refined or is missing.\n\n\nAttributes & Levels\n10 / 9\nChoice question text is clear and specific; table of all attributes are included.\n8 / 7 / 6\nChoice question text could be improved; table of all attributes are included with some attributes missing.\n5 / 4 / 3\nChoice question text is missing or poorly written / unclear; table of all attributes is missing or unclear.\n\n\nSurvey Content\n10 / 9\nAll required survey components are specified with clear, precise question text included.\n8 / 7 / 6\nSome but not all required survey components are specified.\n5 / 4 / 3\nMissing multiple of the required survey components, question text is unclear."

Pilot Analysis Report\nYour report should contain the following items listed as separate sections.\n\nNOTE: You may re-use content from earlier project assignments in this report, such as introductory paragraphs, images, etc.\n\n\nAbstract\nA few sentences summarizing the project and what you found from your pilot analysis. Include:\n\nWhat is the product / policy you are studying?\nWhat were the product attributes and design decisions you were interested in?\nAt least one key insight you gained from your pilot analysis (e.g., a modeling result, a design change you will make for your final survey, etc.).\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nProvide a brief description and background of the product / policy that motivates the study of it. Include a picture or diagram of the product. You should also discuss the key product attributes and decisions variables you chose to study in your pilot survey. This section can be largely similar to your proposal introduction.\n\n\nSurvey Design\nThis section should discuss the design choices you made in creating your pilot survey. Include the following:\n\nDescribe the eligibility requirements you chose and why you chose them.\nWhat information about your respondents did you collect (e.g. critical information questions, demographics, etc.)?\nDescribe any educational material presented to the respondents.\nDefine and justify the attributes and levels chosen for your conjoint choice questions. Indicate the number of alternatives per choice question and the number of choice questions per respondent.\nIf you included a “no-choice” option, define its meaning and state how that was communicated to the respondent.\nInclude an example figure of a random conjoint question (this can be a screen shot).\n\nYou should include a full copy of your survey in an appendix (see the Appendix section below)\n\n\nPilot Data Analysis\nThis section should describe the analysis you carried out using your pilot data, including the following subsections:\n\nSample Description\nDescribe your respondent sample, including the total sample size, the total number of choice question responses, and summary statistics of how your sample varies across critical information questions, demographics, etc. You should also include a description of what your target demographics should look like and compare these to your pilot sample (obviously your pilot sample was your classmates, so it may not be too representative of the target).\n\n\nData Cleaning\nDescribe any filtering process you applied to your data. Summarize how many acceptable vs. rejected responses you kept in your analysis and justify how you made that determination.\n\n\nModeling\nWrite out the specific utility model you estimated. This online LaTeX equation editor might come in handy for this (also, some example LaTeX equations can be found in the class notes from previous classes). Include a summary table of your utility coefficient estimates with standard errors. You should also include summary figures of the estimated coefficients for all attributes. Your figures should include uncertainty bounds. Interpret and discuss the implications of your findings.\n\n\nPower Analysis\nYou should also include a description of conclusions from your power analysis, including a summary figure of your power analysis results (standard errors versus sample size).\n\n\n\nChanges to Final Survey\nBased on your analyses, write a description of any changes you plan on making to your final survey (which should be based on your pilot survey). Consider the following:\n\nDid you make any changes to the product attributes and / or levels?\nDo you expect to be able to obtain the necessary sample size for your analysis?\nOther useful feedback did you receive from respondents / classmates that informed a design change.\n\n\n\nAppendix\nYou should include a full copy of your conjoint survey in an appendix at the end of this report (i.e., the same information and questions respondents saw when taking the survey). This can be the same content used in your .qmd files from the last project assignment (the pilot survey). For the conjoint choice questions, you only need to include one example since the specific levels were different for each choice question."
