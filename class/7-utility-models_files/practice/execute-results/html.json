Write the equation to compute its total probability (hint: think area under the curve!). What is the answer to the equation?\n\nb) A random variable, $\\tilde{x}$, has a uniform distribution between the values 0 and 1. Draw the probability density function (PDF) and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) of $\\tilde{x}$.\n\nc) The value of a random variable, $\\tilde{x}$, is determined by rolling one fair, 6-sided dice. Draw the PDF and CDF of $\\tilde{x}$.\n\n\n\n# HW Question 2\n\na) A consumer is making a choice between two bars of chocolate: milk chocolate $(m)$ and dark chocolate $(d)$. Assume that we know the observed utility of each bar to be $v_m = 3$ and $v_d = 4$. Using a logit model, compute the probabilities of choosing each bar: $P_m$ and $P_d$.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write code here\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nb) A third bar of chocolate is now added to the choice set. It is the exact same as the milk chocolate bar, but it has a slightly different wrapper (which has no effect on the consumer's utility). Now,  $v_{m1} = v_{m2} = 3$, and $v_d = 4$. Based on the probabilities from question a), what would we expect the probabilities of choosing each bar to be? What probabilities does the logit model produce?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# HW Question 3\n\n|Attribute |Bar 1 |Bar 2 |Bar 3 |\n|----------|------|------|------|\n|Price     |$1.20 |$1.50 |$3.00 |\n|% Cacao   |10%   |60%   |80%   |\n\na) Write out a model for the observed utility of each chocolate bar in the above set.\n\nb) If the coefficient for the _price_ attribute was -0.1 and the coefficient for % _Cacao_ attribute was 0.1, what is the difference in the observed utility between bars 3 and 1?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nc) With the addition of the _brand_ attribute, repeat part a.\n\n|Attribute |Bar 1   |Bar 2 |Bar 3       |\n|----------|--------|------|------------|\n|Price     |$1.20   |$1.50 |$3.00       |\n|% Cacao   |10%     |60%   |80%         |\n|Brand     |Hershey |Lindt |Ghirardelli |\n\n\n\n\n# In Class Question 1\n\nLet's say our utility function is:\n\n$$v_j = \\beta_1 x_j^{\\mathrm{price}} + \\beta_2 x_j^{\\mathrm{cacao}} + \\beta_3 \\delta_j^{\\mathrm{hershey}} + \\beta_4 \\delta_j^{\\mathrm{lindt}}$$\n\nAnd we estimate the following coefficients:\n\nParameter | Coefficient\n----------|-----------\n$\\beta_1$ | -0.1\n$\\beta_2$ | 0.1\n$\\beta_3$ | -2.0\n$\\beta_4$ | -0.1\n\na) What are the expected probabilities of choosing each of these bars using a logit model?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your solution here\n```\n:::\n\n\nb) What price would Bar 2 have to be to get a 50% market share?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your solution here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# In Class Question 2\n\n1.
