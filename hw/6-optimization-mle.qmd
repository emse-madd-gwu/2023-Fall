### 1. Getting Organized

Download and edit [this template](`r url_template`) when working through this assignment. This is for now mostly a blank file that you can use to jot down examples and play with code.

Notice that this week's template is a `.qmd` file, which is called a "Quarto Markdown" file (or just "Quarto" file). You'll learn about what these files are and how they are different from .R files in the readings for this week. From now on, we'll mostly be using Quarto files for our assignments (including your project deliverables).

### 2. Readings

Last week we introduced the concept of utility models, which is the primary theoretical framework we'll be using to construct our choice models.

This week, we'll be learning about how we estimate the unknown parameters of those models by watching the second video in [our Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzFdSE-D7jUQnbczxdjohRqlBBrrsaFFg) on choice modeling: _Maximum Likelihood Estimation & Optimization_

**Take notes** as you watch the video. Throughout the video, I ask practice questions at several places - you should answer to those questions as part of your reflection. You may submit your answers however you wish, e.g. hand-write them on paper and take a picture and / or type answers in your reflection .Rmd file.

### 3. Reflect

Reflect on what you've learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing? Write at least a paragraph in your ``r hw_file`` file, and include at least one question. The teaching team will review the questions we get and will try to answer them either in Slack or in class.

If you're unsure where to start with a reflection, try filling out this template:

> "I used to think ______, now I think ______ ðŸ¤”"

### 4. Submit

To submit your assignment, follow these instructions:

1. Render your .qmd file by either clicking the "Render" button in RStudio or running the command ``r paste0('quarto::quarto_render("', hw_file, '")')`` command.
2. Open the rendered html file and make sure it looks good! Is all the formatting as you expected?
3. Create a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment and submit it on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.
